Why we need deep copy sometimes(like found in section 2.6)?
The line w = copy.deepcopy(w_in) is a common Python idiom used to create a deep copy of an object. This is particularly useful in the context of functions when you want to avoid modifying the original object passed to the function.

Breakdown:
copy Module: This line requires the copy module, which provides the deepcopy function.

```python
Copy code
import copy
deepcopy Function:
```
A deep copy creates a new object that is a copy of the original object, and it recursively copies all objects found within the original object.
This is in contrast to a shallow copy, which only copies the outer object and references to the inner objects, meaning changes to the inner objects in the copy will affect the original.
Why Use deepcopy?
Avoid Modifying Globals: If w is meant to be modified within the function but you want to preserve the original w_in (the input variable), using deepcopy ensures that changes to w will not affect w_in.
Complex Objects: When dealing with complex data structures (like nested lists or dictionaries), deep copies are essential to ensure that no shared references exist between the original and the copy.
Example:
Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate this:
```python
Copy code
import copy

def modify_weights(w_in):
    # Create a deep copy of w_in to work with
    w = copy.deepcopy(w_in)  
    w[0] += 1  # Modify the copied weights
    return w

# Original weights
weights = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Call the function
modified_weights = modify_weights(weights)

print("Original weights:", weights)       # Original remains unchanged
print("Modified weights:", modified_weights)  # Changes are reflected here
```
Output:
```lua
Copy code
Original weights: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
Modified weights: [[2, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
In this example, the original weights array remains unchanged even after modifying w inside the modify_weights function, thanks to using deepcopy.
