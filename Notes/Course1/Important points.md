In machine learning, np refers to NumPy, a Python library used for efficient numerical computations. It plays a key role in handling large datasets by providing multi-dimensional arrays (np.array) and offering fast mathematical operations. NumPy is commonly used for linear algebra, matrix manipulations, random number generation, and statistical calculationsâ€”crucial for training models and performing optimizations.
