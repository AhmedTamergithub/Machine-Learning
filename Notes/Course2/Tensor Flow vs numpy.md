The key differences between TensorFlow and NumPy are:

Purpose:

NumPy: A library mainly used for numerical computing and handling multi-dimensional arrays. It's great for basic scientific computations.
TensorFlow: A more advanced framework used for building and training machine learning and deep learning models. It also supports numerical computation but is optimized for large-scale models and GPU/TPU acceleration.
Computation Type:

NumPy: Operates on eager execution mode, meaning operations are computed immediately.
TensorFlow: Can use eager execution or graph-based execution, where computations are defined in a graph and can be optimized for distributed systems.
GPU Support:

NumPy: Runs on CPUs and doesn't have built-in support for GPU acceleration.
TensorFlow: Has built-in support for running operations on GPUs and TPUs, making it faster for deep learning tasks.
Use Case:

NumPy: Primarily used for general numerical operations like matrix manipulations, linear algebra, and other basic computations.
TensorFlow: Primarily used for machine learning and deep learning tasks, especially training large neural networks.
In summary, NumPy is great for basic numerical computations, while TensorFlow is designed for more complex tasks, especially machine learning, 
with support for GPU acceleration and optimized execution.
