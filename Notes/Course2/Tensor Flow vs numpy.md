The key differences between TensorFlow and NumPy are:

1.Purpose:

NumPy: A library mainly used for numerical computing and handling multi-dimensional arrays. It's great for basic scientific computations.

TensorFlow: A more advanced framework used for building and training machine learning and deep learning models. It also supports numerical computation but is optimized for large-scale models and GPU/TPU acceleration.

2.Computation Type:
NumPy: Operates on eager execution mode, meaning operations are computed immediately.
TensorFlow: Can use eager execution or graph-based execution, where computations are defined in a graph and can be optimized for distributed systems.

3.GPU support:
NumPy: Runs on CPUs and doesn't have built-in support for GPU acceleration.
TensorFlow: Has built-in support for running operations on GPUs and TPUs, making it faster for deep learning tasks.

4.Use Case:

NumPy: Primarily used for general numerical operations like matrix manipulations, linear algebra, and other basic computations.
TensorFlow: Primarily used for machine learning and deep learning tasks, especially training large neural networks.
